        "\n",
        "Word vectors (also known as 'word embeddings') are one of the most popular kinds of AI models. They are extremely useful in many domains. In essence, a word vector is a set of numbers that attempt to capture the meaning of a word. In typical implementations, each word is represented by a set of 200-300 numbers. In linear algebra, a one-dimensional array of numbers is known as a 'vector', hence these sets of numbers representing words' meanings are known as 'word vectors'.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using neural networks, we can expose the computer to a large amount of text, and allow it to learn an appropriate set of numbers for each word it encounters. In this notebook, we will learn about the most famous of all word vector algorithms, `word2vec`, which was first described by Tomas Mikolov and his team in 2013:\n",

        "Word vectors allow the computer to 'understand' language far more effectively. Rather than seeing each word as simply an arbitrarily different object, a computer using word vectors can analyse each word as a point in 200- or 300-dimenstional space. Words that are similar in meaning will have similar word vectors. And as we will see, the spaces between the word vectors are also significant: the words are arranged in patterns that represent their relationships to one another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Accordingly, most AI systems that process language now include a word vector layer as part of their architecure. When the system encounters some text (e.g. when you speak to Siri or Alexa), your words are converted into word vectors, *and then* the computer examines what the text says and determines how it should respond.\n",
